Lab 6:  Lab7-CIFAR10_BaloonFlight.docx

The Lab includes 3 parts: CNN-Baseline+Increasing Dropout + Data Augmentation + Batch Normalization + Your own method, CNN - Challenge test and a game development: Balloon Flight. 

For CNN, as part of the code was given and would run in Google Colab, the main objective is to compile and train the model to achieve the highest accuracy as possible. My model have the accuracy more than 88%.

For CNN-Challenge test, the options are either running on Google Colab or use two files "CNNbaseline.py " and "CNNbaseline.py " provided on Canvas. 

For Game Development-Balloon Flight, 

In order to operate both programs from the same source code each source code for each program had to be chnaged in some manner. 

Do not delete any images in the folder with the application.
Do not edit the code in the application usless for development purpose.
Do not copy the code for business uses.

1. Click on the link below to open the Google Colab to run the accuracy code. 
    -The black circle icon on the left-top conner of each block in the webpage. 
    -More code "history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=2000, " have beed added to block 9       to design how many times of training to run. 
    -Click run button block 13 and 14 saving the rnning results and download the code to local.
    -Run block 15 to load the history back to Code.
    -Another option is to pull the file "CNNbaseline" to Spyer to run the file.

2. Pull the game named "balloon2" into Spyder. 
    -Click green button to run the program and play the game.
    -You controll Mario to rise or just let it falls. Click the mouse to rise Mario and stay away from any obstacles. 
    -Check the scores the range of the user's play. 


3. Test Image.
    -Pull the code "test_image" into Spyer.
    -Change the picture url to change the picture.
    -Observe the accuracy of each picture.
